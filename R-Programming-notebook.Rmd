# R Console Input and Evaluation
<br>

### Entering input
```{r Entering input}
x <- 1
print(x)
x
msg <- "hello"

## x <- ##Incomplete expression
```

### Evaluation
```{r Evaluation}
x <- 5 ## nothing happens
x ## auto-printing occurs

print(x) ## explicit printing

## [1] indicates that x is a vector and 5 is the first element.
```

### Printing
```{r Printing}
## The : operator is used to create integer sequences.
x <- 1:20 
x
```

### R Objects and Attributes


#### Objects 

R has 5 basic classes of objects

- character  
- numeric (real numbers)  
- integer  
- complex  
- logical (T/F)  

The most basic object is a vector


- A vector can only contain objects of the same class  
- BUT: The one exception is a *list*, which is represented as a vector but can contain objects of different classes (indeed, that's usually why we use them)

Empty vectors can be created with the 
```{r}
vector()
```
function.

#### Numbers

- Numbers in R are generally treated as numeric objects (i.e. double precision real numbers)  
- If you explicitly want an integer, you need to specify the **L** suffix  
- Ex: Entering 1 gives you a numeric object; entering 1**L** explicitly gives you an integer.  
- There is also a special number **Inf** which represents infinity: e.g. 1/0; **Inf** can be used in ordinary calculations; e.g. 1/**Inf** is 0  
- The value **NaN** represents an undefined value ("not a number); e.g. 0/0; **NaN** can also be thought of as a missing value  

#### Attributes

R objects can have attributes

- names, dimensions  
- dimensions (e.g. matrices, arrays)  
- class  
- length  
- other user-defined attributes/metadata  

Attributes of an object can be accessed using the 
```{r}
##attributes()
```
function.
